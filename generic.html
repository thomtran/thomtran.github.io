									<p>Wake up at 4:30AM every morning. and starts his morning with a jog 4 miles around a lake near his house.</p>
									<p>Drive to work around 6:00AM. This is an excellent way to skip traffic, get to work early, and pump out some work while there are no e-mails or pings throughout the day yet.</p>
									<p>Get home around 5:00PM. With remaining free time in the day spend time with family. Work on creating content. Edit videos. If there happens to be a lot to complete at work, then make sure to complete all important tasks before taking off for the day.</p>

<p>Finish off the day with stretches and mobility, core, and strength exercises. Use this as an opportunity to also destress. Sleep by 10:00PM, and get ready to repeat for the next day.<p>

									<h2>4 Mile Jog</h2>
									<p>A long run in the morning, plus some body weight exercises, is a great way to kick start the day. It enforces discipline, because it forces you to wake up incredibly early everyday. Also, running also incredibly mental, and being able to accomplish a challenging task first thing after waking up will start the day on a good note. Furthermore, running will help clear the mind. I very rarely run without listening to either the news, a podcast, audiobook, or Spotify music. (Most of the time I listen to music towards the end of the run for extra motivation). I also perform 100 push ups, and 40 pull ups before I call it a day.</p>
									<p>I do not have my first meal, until typically around 11:00-1:00PM. I try to eat within a fasting window to stay leaner, and also keep my mind from being dulled down by food or coffee. I will drink coffee later in the day if I need a boost, mornings are usually for tea and water. I try to keep most of my meals low carb, with high protein. I find that carbs make it easier for me to gain weight, and I prefer feeling light after each meal. Except on weekends, I tend to be much more open to eat whatever is on my plate, because I need to take a break sometimes.</p>

									<h2>After Work</h2>
									<p>If I can, I try to spend the rest of my time creating/working on producing my own content. Such as this website. The purpose is to keep my mind actively engaged, and for me to eventually have something that I can look back on, and remark on all of my accomplishments at.

I enjoy taking photos. Please see the photo collection. More content to be uploaded throughout the website</p>
