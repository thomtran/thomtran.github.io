										<h1>Notes on how I Stumbled into my Purpose in Life (For Now)</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>The Intro</h2>
									<p>A few years ago, I attended a motivational seminar on the purpose of life, presented by Nick Vujicic, a man with no arms and no legs, with a good friend of mine, Pavan Nayak. This was right after a terrible bike accident I had, which in many ways, had been a rude awakening to the fragility of life, and the need to make the most out the time we have. So the purpose of life, according to Nick Vujicic, was something related to Christianity, and remaining faithful to the religion. This was something I couldn’t relate to myself, however I realized there that I could not have someone tell me the purpose of life, I would have to go find it myself.</p>
									
									<h2>Fast Forward 3 1/2 years later </h2>
									<p>It is my last day at the first company I joined coming out of college. I am leaving Deloitte to join another consulting group called Slalom Consulting, to become a strategist. </P>
									<p>I am reflecting on how much I have learned since leaving college, and also remarking on how little it all amounted to. I am only two years into my career, so I am incredibly proud to say “this is just the beginning”. Yet I also feel like I’ve made a mark, and can only go up from here. As I was walking around, taking photos of my surroundings in the city, I also realized something about myself. That I am hungry, no starving to create in impact in this world. I’m still unsure how I am going to do it, but as I was walking through the city, I was also searching through my head for a meaning, trying to understand myself better. And i realized, that I want to do more than just merely exist. I am always trying to draw meaning from everything I do, which is why I am realizing that my potential lies heavily in understanding the big picture, and helping whoever I work with to do the same. Therefore the type of work I should be doing needs to be geared towards helping organizations obtain as they can from learning from the big picture. I am deciding now, at the age of 24, that this is the type of difference I want to make.</p>
									<p>And then I realized, what it means to truly make a difference - for anyone to truly make a difference, you must understand what your purpose is. Everyone defines purpose a bit differently, however I am going to align my definition of purpose to be with doing what you enjoy most, that is productive, and also beneficial to society. For example, you can do what I do for a living, strategy consulting, and absolutely hate it, but you can still make enough money to provide for those you love, as well as benefit the organizations you consult for. This would not be your life’s purpose. The hardest part is finding your purpose in life, which also has a lot to do with where you are in life as well. If you are a student, your purpose should be to study and learn as much as you can, so you can have a career. If you are already fully employed, but do not enjoy what you do for a living, your priority should be to find what your purpose is in life. Unfortunately, some people are luckier than others, and they find their life calling sooner. However, life is short, if you don’t like what you are doing, go try other things. If you are not given an opportunity, or are not fortunate enough to have someone invest to teach you a new trade, you must apply extra force by self-learning, and applying your learning in practice, either doing pro-bono work, or when you interview for new positions. </p>
