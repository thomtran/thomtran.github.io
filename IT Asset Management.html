										<h1>Improving IT Asset Management</h1>
									</header>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Sample Case</h2>
									<p>A multi billion dollar company is hit with several Software audit fines throughout the year. After paying millions of dollars in response to fees & settlements, the organization is now ready to invest in improved IT Asset Management (ITAM) processes. The oCIO/CISO is also discovering that the organization does not have a single source of truth for obtaining the license position for its hardware and software assets, impacting the business's ability to make well informed IT asset demand forecasting & budgeting decisions. </p>
									<p>Draft a business plan with risks and assumptions called out for what you would suggest to identify pain points in the organization's existing ITAM processes & controls. Also create sample reccomendations.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Background: What is IT Asset Management? Why is it important?</h2>
									<p>All organizations must have processes for tracking IT Asset purchases and deployment to create an accurate license position. A license position is defined as the number of instances an organization is entitled to, compared to the actual number of instances being used.</p>
									<p>IT Asset Management (ITAM) is defined as an organization's processes & controls for tracking IT purchases. Effective ITAM will help organizations obtain the total IT estate, which helps with allocating budget for forecasting additional hardware & software purchases in the coming year. lastly, ITAM should be thought of as the umbrella term for an organization’s Hardware Asset Management (HAM) and Software Asset Management (SAM). </p>
									<p>Understanding where and how IT assets are allocated throughout the organization is fundamental for making decisions related to expanding the organization’s IT estate. Furthermore,  having effective ITAM will help organization's respond to Software Audit Requests with an accurate license position. For a real-world example of the impact a negative software audit can have on a company, search "Nike & Quest Audit".</p>
									<p>Lastly, improved tracking of IT Assets will mitigate Cyber Risk implications. Think of it this way, if an organization does not know where IT assets are deployed throughout the environment, there is a higher risk of unintended third-parties obtaining confidential data. </p>

								<h2>Step 1: Meet with existing ITAM Stakeholders</h2>
								<p> The first step to conducting an ITAM current state assessment is to understand the existing processes & controls, involved personnel, and current spend numbers on all hardware & software purchases. To do this, meet with stakeholders from the following groups:</p>
								<ul>
								<li>Finance, Accounting, and Procurement</li>
								<li>Infrastructure & Operations</li>
								<li>Enterprise Architecture</li>
								<li>Internal Audit</li>
								<li>The Organization's License Compliance Team</li>
								<li>Office of the CIO/CTO</li>
								</ul>
								
			
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 2: Map Current-State ITAM Org Chart, and Existing Processes & Tools</h2>
								<p> After meeting with all members from the above teams, and additional members as needed, document existing processes and tools used by the organization to perform ITAM activities. It is reccomended to create a heat mapping of different tools used throughout the organization, as well as a Swimlane diagram to capture different processes throughout different teams. This is also an opportunity to assess for redundant processes</p>
			
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 3: Demonstrate the ITAM Lifecycle</h2>
								<p>The following diagram depicts the entire IT Asset Management Lifecycle from the beginning of an Asset's life, to retirement</p>
								<a class="image"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 4: Define Key Performance Indicators for why client should care about ITAM </h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Increased Annual Cost Savings Opportunities</li>
								<li>Increased Software Audit Response Efficiency</li>
								<li>Identity Symptoms of an Immature ITAM Environment, and Measures for Improvement</li>
								<li>Increase Overall Organization Decision Making for IT Budgeting, and Tech Strategy</li>
								</ul>
								
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 5:  Map out the client’s existing ITAM Governance Model, and all stakeholders involved</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>For each stakeholder group, document existing ITAM processes, and pinpoint areas where processes are redundant, or are creating pain points for existing stakeholders.</li>
								<li>For each pain point identified, document recommendations to improve existing processes.</li>
								<li>For each client stakeholder group, understand how many employees there are, and estimate the amount of hours spent per week on unstandardized ITAM Activities. Research Gartner to pull industry standard hours that should be spent per week on ITAM. </li>
								</ul>
								
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 6:  Obtain and Normalize Spend Data</h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Normalize data via the following: Find inconsistent naming conventions, and rename i.e. (Amazon & AWS can be categorized as the same). </li>
								<li>Find a way to classify re-sellers, and bucket these items into their own category.</li>
								<li>Identify blanket purchases, and find ways to categorize these. Blanket purchases are typically for miscellaneous items, and by quantifying how much was spent on misc. Blanket items, you can demonstrate to the client that there is a need to standardize procurement operations to better capture these types of purchases, thereby increasing reliability of ITAM data.</li>
								<li>Identify Service fees, and look through the data to make sure that software/hardware purchases are not being miscategorized as service fees.</li>
								<li>Looking through major known resellers i.e. (CDW, Computacenter, Dell, En Pointe Technologies, ePlus, Insight, PC Connection, PC-Ware, SHI International, Softchoice) and be sure to pull the actual sellers from this data. For example, CDW might resell for Dell. Try to classify these types of purchases to be from Dell, not CDW. </li>
								</ul>
								
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Step 7: Analyze Spend Data </h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Pull the total amount spent on Hardware, Software, Resellers, Misc. Costs.. Etc.</li>
								<li>Pull the amount spent per year, total spent overall, and analyze the amount spent year over year to forecast how much the company will continue to spend, depending on IT initiatives. </li>
								<li>Map out how much the client is spending on ITAM every year, and where the trend is. Show the difference between how much the client will spend three years out, if they do not do anything to improve ITAM, versus if they were to implement ITAM organizational effectiveness, standardize ITAM processes & Controls, and potentially implement a SAM Tool. </li>
								</ul>
								
								<hr class ="major" />
								<h2>Reccomended Next Steps </h2>
								<ul>
								<li>Centralize the ITAM lifecycle.</li>
								<li>Define organizational structure for responding to Audit requests, and responsibilities throughout the organization for managing ITAM. </li>
								<li>Consider automation through purchasing a SAM Tool.</li>
								<li>Consider putting together an effective license position for the client’s major vendors.</li>
								</ul>
