										<h1>What Does a Consultant Actually do?</h1>
									</header>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Well it depends...</h2>
									<p>It really depends on what kind of consulting you are hired to do. however, the purpose for why consultants boil down to two reasons: A company is either trying to build out processes to save on costs, or is trying to implement a program to increase growth.</P>
									<h2>Management Consulting, in a nutshell</h2>
									<p>Think of what Mechanics are for. Your car breaks down, or you notice something seems off, or you want to made modifications to the car. Rather than doing the work yourself, because maybe you do not know how, or don’t have the time to invest/learn, you bring it to a mechanic to diagnose, treat, and fix your issues, or make enhancements to your vehicle. They then charge you for labor and parts. </p>
									<p>This is what a consultant does, for a business. As such, there are so many types of consultants, ranging from strategy & operations, to supply chain management, finance & accounting, and asset management.</p>
									
									<h2>My Experience in the Consulting (So Far...)</h2>
									<p>I was an IT Asset Management Consultant at Deloitte for 2 years, where my job was to diagnose, and fix my client’s IT Asset management processes. Similar to how mechanics diagnose and repair car problems, my job was to interview stakeholders throughout the business to understand existing ITAM processes, document those, and point out any pain points & my recommendations for how the business could improve its processes. The end goal was to help clients build a program to allow them to better manage/track their IT Assets. And similar to what Mechanics do, I billed them on every hour I spent. </p>
								
								<h2>Hopefully this Answers your Questions</h2>
								<p>Unlike mechanics, consultants make money based on a signed Statement of Work (SoW). This is used to define the type of services the consultant will be performing, in my case, it would be a current state assessment, and building out a future state roadmap for clients to implement better ITAM porcesses & Controls. The statement of work also breaks down who is on the team, the hourly rate, and the amount of hours required to complete the work. So unlike mechanics, the amount paid is agreed upon in the beginning, and is paid before consultants come onsite to begin conducting interviews, assessing the environment, and making recommendations.</P> 

<p>The lifecycle of a consulting project, typically follows this format: Current State Assessment -> build future state roadmap/strategy -> implement future state reccomendations -> optimize manaul processes & controls -> automate with software.
